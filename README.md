# Usage:

Open the Dino game (instruction above).</br>
Start the python scrpit by typing this in command prompt:</br>
`python dino.py`

To Exit press ctrl+c on windows or just close the command prompt

# Extra:

Edit the `time.sleep()` to edit the time that dino takes to land </br>
Edit the `region=(360,565,163,100)` to change the detection box </br>

# Note:
This is just a simple static script and not an evolving AI (which uses NEAT or something) so don't except super high scores but editing the parameters can easily help you score a couple thousand point :)
